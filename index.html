				<p>ALPHA Formula – Bring out the SUPERHUMAN in YOU</p>

					<p>Feeling… 
					…slow, lethargic and far from the youthful self that you used to be 
					…uncomfortable and loosing sex drive
					…tired and struggling to get a good nights of sleep
					…unhealthy, overweight and lacking self-confidence</p> 

					<p>Fat, flab, blubber, roly-poly - whatever you want to call it; the truth is we all would like to loose a bit of it. Prime health and fitness, something we all strive for. As personal trainers we have seen the spectrum of shortcuts some of our clients have undertaken, from diet fads to weight-loss pills, to shed the pounds. Unfortunately, these approaches can be harmful and often come at a significant cost to the individual’s health and pocket.</p>

					<p>Today, the diversity of the health information being promoted by the saturated market may have left you struggling to find the ideal fitness and nutrition plan to achieve your personal aspirations. Moreover, our day-to-day commitments alongside the existing confusion about nutrition and training only delays progress.</p> 

					<p>Are you ready to take the leap and find that true potential and bring out that superhuman in you?</p>

					<p>…Yes?</p>

					<p>Well, come JOIN US – we are here to help</p> 

					<p>ALPHA fitness - ALPHA nutrition - ALPHA body
					WE ARE ALPHA</p>
